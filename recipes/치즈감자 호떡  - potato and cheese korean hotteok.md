# 🥔🧀 _치즈감자 호떡_  - potato and cheese korean hotteok

## 🍳 ingredients

- 4 potatoes
- a pinch of salt and black pepper
- 1 tablespoon of brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons of corn starch (1 tbsp for each potato used)

## 📑 instructions

start by cutting the potatoes into small pieces. put the pieces in a pan with water and boil them until they're soft. remove the potatoes from the pan, put in a bowl and mash them. add in the salt, the black pepper, the sugar, the corn starch and mix everything. make a little ball with the mix and open it on the palm of your hand so it's the same size. add the cheese and carefully close it in a ball again using your fingertips, then squeeze it a little to make a disk. be careful not to leave any parts open or cracked, or the cheese might spill out once you put it on the frying pan.

on a frying pan, put on some cooking oil and then add between 1-2 hotteoks (depending on the size of your frying pan), but make sure to leave some space bewteen them. cook on low to medium heat until both sides are golden. enjoy! 😋
